  "summary": "The code in this file provides two utility functions, `wait` and `forTrue`, which are designed to help manage asynchronous operations in the larger babyagi-ts project. Both functions return Promises, making them suitable for use with `async/await` syntax.\n\n### wait function\n\nThe `wait` function takes two arguments: `timeoutMs`, which is the number of milliseconds to wait before resolving the Promise, and an optional `value` parameter, which defaults to `null`. The purpose of this function is to create a delay in the execution of asynchronous code. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to wait for a specific amount of time before proceeding with the next operation.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nasync function example() {\n  console.log(\"Starting...\");\n  await wait(1000); // Wait for 1 second\n  console.log(\"...Finished\");\n}\n```\n\n### forTrue function\n\nThe `forTrue` function takes a single argument, `fn`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. The purpose of this function is to repeatedly check the result of the `fn` function until it returns `true` or a maximum number of attempts (200 in this case) is reached. The function checks the result of `fn` every 50 milliseconds. If `fn` returns `true`, the Promise resolves with the value `true`. If the maximum number of attempts is reached without `fn` returning `true`, the Promise is rejected.\n\nThis function can be useful in scenarios where you need to wait for a specific condition to be met before proceeding with the next operation, such as waiting for an element to be visible on a web page or for a specific value to be present in a data store.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nasync function waitForElement() {\n  const elementExists = () => document.querySelector(\"#my-element\") !== null;\n  try {\n    await forTrue(elementExists);\n    console.log(\"Element found!\");\n  } catch {\n    console.log(\"Element not found after waiting\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, this file provides two utility functions that help manage asynchronous operations in the babyagi-ts project by introducing delays and waiting for specific conditions to be met.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `wait` function?**\n\n   The `wait` function is an asynchronous utility function that resolves a promise after a specified timeout in milliseconds, optionally returning a value when the promise resolves.\n\n2. **How does the `forTrue` function work and what is its use case?**\n\n   The `forTrue` function takes a function `fn` as an argument, which should return a boolean value. It repeatedly checks the result of `fn` every 50 milliseconds, and resolves a promise when `fn` returns `true`. It can be used to wait for a certain condition to become true before proceeding with the execution of the code.\n\n3. **Is there a limit to the number of times the `forTrue` function checks the result of `fn`?**\n\n   Yes, the `forTrue` function checks the result of `fn` up to 200 times. If `fn` does not return `true` within these 200 checks, the promise is rejected."
